## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is JSON?
JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a standard text-based format for representing structured data based on JavaScript object syntax. It is commonly used for transmitting data in web applications (e.g., sending some data from the server to the client, so it can be displayed on a web page, or vice versa)
JSON is a text-based data format following JavaScript object syntax
Even though it closely resembles JavaScript object literal syntax, it can be used independently from JavaScript, and many programming environments feature the ability to read (parse) and generate JSON.
- What are serialization and deserialization?
Converting a string to a native object is called deserialization, while converting a native object to a string so it can be transmitted across the network is called serialization.
- Why are serialization and deserialization useful?
Overall, serialization and deserialization are important techniques for managing data in JavaScript and are essential for effective communication between different systems and applications.
- How do you serialize a data structure into a JSON string using JavaScript?
using JSON.stringify()method
- How do you deserialize a JSON string into a data structure using JavaScript?
using JSON.parse()method
