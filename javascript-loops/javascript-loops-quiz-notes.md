## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is the purpose of a loop?
a loop is used to repeat a block of code multiple times. It allows you to iterate over a set of values or perform a set of actions repeatedly until a certain condition is met.

- What is the purpose of a **condition** expression in a loop?
 a condition expression in a loop is used to determine whether the loop should continue running or stop. The condition is checked at the beginning of each iteration of the loop. If the condition is true, the loop body is executed. If the condition is false, the loop terminates.

- What does "iteration" mean in the context of loops?
 Each time the block of code is executed, it is considered one "iteration" of the loop.
When a loop is executed, it starts with an initial value and repeats the block of code until a certain condition is met. In each iteration of the loop, the block of code is executed again with a new value. This process continues until the condition is no longer true, at which point the loop terminates.

- _When_ does the **condition** expression of a `while` loop get evaluated?
The condition expression of a while loop gets evaluated at the beginning of each iteration of the loop, and it determines whether the loop body should be executed or no

- _When_ does the **initialization** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?
 The initialization expression of a for loop is evaluated once, before the loop starts executing. The initialization expression is the first part of the for loop syntax and is executed before the condition expression and the loop body.

- _When_ does the **condition** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?
 The condition expression of a for loop gets evaluated at the beginning of each iteration of the loop, before the loop body is executed.
- _When_ does the **final** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?
 The final expression of a for loop gets evaluated at the end of each iteration, after the loop body has been executed. The final expression is the third part of the for loop syntax, and it typically updates the loop variable to prepare for the next iteration.

- Besides a `return` statement, which exits its entire function block, which keyword exits a loop before its **condition** expression evaluates to `false`?
 The break keyword is used to exit a loop before its condition expression evaluates to false, and it is useful when you want to terminate a loop early based on a certain condition.
- What does the `++` increment operator do?
 increments a variable by 1 after each iteration of the loop
- How do you iterate through the keys of an object?
You can iterate through the keys of an object using a for...in loop.
