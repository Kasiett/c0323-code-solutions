## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is a **method**?

A method is a function which is a property of an object. There are two kinds of methods: instance methods which are built-in tasks performed by an object instance, or static methods which are tasks that are called directly on an object constructor.

- How can you tell the difference between a method
_definition_ and a method _call_?
Method Definition: A method definition is the actual implementation of a method in a programming language. It defines the behavior of a method, including its name, parameters, and the code block that gets executed when the method is invoked. It typically includes the method signature, which specifies the method name and the input parameters it accepts, and the method body, which contains the code that gets executed when the method is called. Method definitions are usually defined within a class or an object, and they serve as blueprints for creating instances of objects with the same behavior.
 Method Call: A method call, also known as a method invocation or method execution, is the act of actually invoking a method with a particular set of arguments, causing the method's code to be executed. It is the way to use the behavior defined in a method definition. When a method is called, the code inside the method's body is executed with the provided arguments, and the method can return a value or perform some action.
- Describe method **definition** syntax (structure).
The method definition, also known as a function definition or a method signature, is the syntax or structure used in a programming language to define the implementation of a method or function. The exact syntax for defining a method may vary depending on the programming language being used, but there are common elements that are typically included in most method definitions
- Describe method **call** syntax (structure).
function name period method name and arguments
- How is a method different from any other function?
associated with the function
- What is the **defining characteristic** of
Object-Oriented Programming?

- What are the four "principles" of Object-Oriented Programming?
Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the process of hiding the internal details and state of an object, and exposing only what is necessary. This is achieved through the use of classes and objects, where classes define the structure and behavior of objects, and objects are instances of classes. Encapsulation helps in achieving data abstraction, information hiding, and modularization.

Inheritance: Inheritance is the process by which one class inherits properties and methods from another class. The class that inherits properties and methods is called a subclass or derived class, and the class from which properties and methods are inherited is called a superclass or base class. Inheritance allows for the creation of a hierarchical relationship between classes, where subclasses can inherit and extend the functionality of their superclass.

Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as if they were of the same class. Polymorphism enables the use of a common interface or method across multiple classes, providing flexibility and extensibility in object-oriented designs. Polymorphism allows for code reusability and promotes loose coupling between objects, making it easier to change and extend the behavior of objects without affecting the code that uses them.

Abstraction: Abstraction is the process of simplifying complex systems by breaking them down into smaller, manageable parts. In OOP, abstraction is achieved through the use of abstract classes and interfaces. Abstract classes define common characteristics and behavior for a group of related classes, but cannot be instantiated themselves. Interfaces define a common set of methods that classes can implement, providing a contract for how objects should behave without specifying their internal details. Abstraction allows for the creation of high-level, generalized models that can be extended and implemented by concrete classes to achieve specific functionality.

- What does API stand for?
 Application Programming Interface.
- What is the purpose of an API?
purpose of an API is to give a simple consistant way to interact with servers
