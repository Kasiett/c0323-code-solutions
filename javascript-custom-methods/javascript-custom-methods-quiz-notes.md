## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is a **method**?

A method is a function which is a property of an object. There are two kinds of methods: instance methods which are built-in tasks performed by an object instance, or static methods which are tasks that are called directly on an object constructor.

- How can you tell the difference between a method
_definition_ and a method _call_?
Method Definition: A method definition is the actual implementation of a method in a programming language. It defines the behavior of a method, including its name, parameters, and the code block that gets executed when the method is invoked. It typically includes the method signature, which specifies the method name and the input parameters it accepts, and the method body, which contains the code that gets executed when the method is called. Method definitions are usually defined within a class or an object, and they serve as blueprints for creating instances of objects with the same behavior.
 Method Call: A method call, also known as a method invocation or method execution, is the act of actually invoking a method with a particular set of arguments, causing the method's code to be executed. It is the way to use the behavior defined in a method definition. When a method is called, the code inside the method's body is executed with the provided arguments, and the method can return a value or perform some action.
- Describe method **definition** syntax (structure).
The method definition, also known as a function definition or a method signature, is the syntax or structure used in a programming language to define the implementation of a method or function. The exact syntax for defining a method may vary depending on the programming language being used, but there are common elements that are typically included in most method definitions
- Describe method **call** syntax (structure).
function name period method name and arguments
- How is a method different from any other function?
associated with the function
- What is the **defining characteristic** of
Object-Oriented Programming?

- What are the four "principles" of Object-Oriented Programming?

- What is "abstraction"?

- What does API stand for?
 Application Programming Interface.
- What is the purpose of an API?
purpose of an API is to give a simple consistant way to interact with servers
