## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is the default `flex-direction` of a `flex` container?
The default value of flex-direction for a flex container in CSS is row. This means that the flex items inside the container will be positioned along the main axis from left to right, and along the cross axis from top to bottom by default.
- What is the default `flex-wrap` of a `flex` container?
The default value of flex-wrap for a flex container in CSS is nowrap. This means that by default, the flex items inside the container will be placed in a single line and will not wrap to the next line, even if there isn't enough space in the container to display all the items in a single row.
- What axis do the `justify-content` properties work on?
The justify-content property in CSS works along the main axis of a flex container. The main axis is determined by the flex-direction property, which defines the direction in which the flex items are arranged inside the container.
- What axis do the `align-items` properties work on?
 The cross axis is perpendicular to the main axis, and its direction is determined by the flex-direction property.
