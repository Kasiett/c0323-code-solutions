## Quiz Questions

- Why do two div elements "vertically stack" on one another by default?

- What are the three primary components of a page layout? (Which helper classes do you need?)
Containers, column, row are used to group and organize content within a web page. They define a block-level element that contains other elements and helps to provide structure to the page.
- What is the minimum number of **columns** that you should put in a **row**?
minimum number of **columns** one
- What is the purpose of a **container**?
The purpose of a container in web development is to provide a fixed width for content and to help organize and structure the content within a web page.

A container is a block-level element that wraps around other HTML elements, such as rows and columns, and provides a consistent and controlled space for the content within it. By setting a maximum width for the container, developers can ensure that the content within it does not become too spread out or difficult to read on larger screens.
