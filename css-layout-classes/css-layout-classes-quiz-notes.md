## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- Why do two div elements "vertically stack" on one another by default?
Two div elements vertically stack on one another by default because the display property of a div element is set to block by default.

- What is the default `flex-direction` of an element with `display: flex`?
The default flex-direction value of an element with display: flex is row.
- What are the three primary components of a page layout? (Which helper classes do you need?)
Containers: Containers are used to group and organize content within a web page. They define a block-level element that contains other elements and helps to provide structure to the page.
- What is the minimum number of **columns** that you should put in a **row**?
There is no minimum number of columns that you should put in a row, as the number of columns used depends on the design and layout of the web page.
However, it's worth noting that the total number of columns in a row should not exceed 12 in order to maintain a responsive layout. This is because Bootstrap's grid system is based on a 12-column layout, and any more than 12 columns in a row can cause layout issues and inconsistencies.
- What is the purpose of a **container**?
The purpose of a container in web development is to provide a fixed width for content and to help organize and structure the content within a web page.

A container is a block-level element that wraps around other HTML elements, such as rows and columns, and provides a consistent and controlled space for the content within it. By setting a maximum width for the container, developers can ensure that the content within it does not become too spread out or difficult to read on larger screens.
