## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What are JavaScript classes?
Classes are a template for creating objects. They encapsulate data with code to work on that data. Classes in JS are built on prototypes but also have some syntax and semantics that are unique to classes.
- When would you want to use a class?
In general, you may want to use classes in JavaScript when you need to create objects with shared properties and methods, organize your code in an object-oriented manner, promote code reusability, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and improve code readability and maintainability.
- How do you declare a class?
declare a class using the class keyword, followed by the class name and {}
- How do you inherit from another class?
using the extends keyword, which allows you to create a subclass (also known as a derived class) that inherits properties and methods from a parent class (also known as a base class).
- Why would you want to inherit from another class?
 inheritance is a powerful mechanism in OOP that promotes code reusability, modularity, and organization, and allows for flexible and extensible object modeling.
- How do you add methods and properties to a class?
Properties inside the constructor
