## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is a client?
a client is a piece of computer hardware or software that accesses a service made available by a server as part of the clientâ€“server model of computer networks.
- What is a server?
a server is a piece of computer hardware or software (computer program) that provides functionality for other programs or devices, called "clients."
- Which HTTP method does a browser issue to a web server when you visit a URL?
The GET method is one of the most commonly used HTTP methods and is used to retrieve information from a web server.
- What three things are on the start-line of an HTTP **request** message?
 "GET" is the HTTP method, "/example.html" is the URL/URI, and "HTTP/1.1" is the HTTP version.
- What three things are on the start-line of an HTTP **response** message?
 "HTTP/1.1" is the HTTP version, "200" is the status code indicating a successful request, and "OK" is the reason phrase providing a human-readable description of the status code.
- What are HTTP headers?
HTTP headers are essential for communication between clients and servers in the HTTP protocol, as they allow for additional instructions and metadata to be conveyed beyond the basic content of the HTTP message body.
HTTP headers are metadata or key-value pairs that are included in both HTTP request and response messages to convey additional information about the message, the requestor, or the server.
- Where would you go if you wanted to learn more about a specific HTTP Header?
Official HTTP specifications: The HTTP protocol is defined by a series of specifications maintained by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) and the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). These specifications, including the HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 specifications, provide detailed information about the syntax, semantics, and usage of various HTTP headers.

- Is a body required for a valid HTTP request or response message?
The presence of a message body in an HTTP request or response message depends on the type of request or response being sent. In some cases, a message body is required, while in others, it may be optional or not allowed at all.
