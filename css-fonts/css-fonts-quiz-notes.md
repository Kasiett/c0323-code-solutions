## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- Name two types of units that can be used to adjust `font-size` in CSS.
pixels -> px, em -> 1em is equivalent to 16 pixels.
- What CSS property controls the font used for the text inside an element?
The font-family property specifies a prioritized list of font family names and/or generic family names for the selected element. The browser will try to use the first font family in the list, and if it is not available, it will try the next one, and so on, until it finds a font that is available on the user's system.
