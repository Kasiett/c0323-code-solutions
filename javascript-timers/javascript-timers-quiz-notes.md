- What is a "callback" function?
A callback function is a function passed into another function as an argument, which is then invoked inside the outer function to complete some kind of routine or action.
- Besides adding an event listener callback function to an element or the `document`, what is one way to delay the execution of a JavaScript function until some point in the future?
setTimeout()

- How can you set up a function to be called repeatedly without using a loop?
setInterval()
- What is the default time delay if you omit the `delay` parameter from `setTimeout()` or `setInterval()`?
zero
- What do `setTimeout()` and `setInterval()` return?
setInterval() ==> returns interval ID
 'setTimeout()' ==> timeoutID is a positive integer value which identifies the timer created by the call to setTimeout(). This value can be passed to clearTimeout() to cancel the timeout.
