## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- How do block-level elements affect the document flow?
Block-level elements take up the entire width of their parent container, pushing any content next to them down to the next line. This means that if you have two block-level elements next to each other, they will appear on separate lines, creating a vertical flow.
also block-level elements have a default margin and padding, which can affect the spacing and layout of the surrounding content. This can cause elements to move up or down in the document flow, depending on their position relative to the block-level element.
- How do inline elements affect the document flow?
Inline elements can be placed within a line of text and do not disrupt the flow of content. This means that if you have two inline elements next to each other, they will appear on the same line, creating a horizontal flow.
- What are the default width and height of a block-level element?
The default height of a block-level element is the height of the content. The default width of a block-level element is the length of the page.
- What are the default width and height of an inline element?
an inline element will take up only as much width as necessary to display its content.
